# X360_CustomGSC_modes-maps
This is just a port of custom gsc scripts that can work on rgh/jtag consoles. 

1. make sure you have the files you want downloaded 
2. pick one of your choosing 
3. place file via usb or 360 neighborhood
4. HDD -> "games" -> "Black ops 2" -> "Raw" -> "maps" -> "mp" -> "gametypes_zm"
5. once you have placed the file rename it to _clientids.gsc 
6. it'll ask you if you want to overwrite the original one so press yes
7. now go back and launch up Black ops 2 and start a match of zombies on solo to test it out. (the game will tell you if you're using the wrong map for the gsc and will also tell you which one you need to play for it to work properly)
8. once you have confirmed it works congratulations you have succesfully added a custom gsc to Black ops 2 on the 360! You can use this gsc online and with friends as long as you are the host! (I would recommend finding a force host infection clip via COD TV)
